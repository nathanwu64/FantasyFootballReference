# Welcome to Fantasy Football Reference
Fantasy Football Reference compiles your complete history of fantasy football leagues in one place. We currently only support Sleeper leagues using the Sleeper API.

All you need is your Sleeper username to see:
- Your championship banners hanging from the rafters
- Historical head to head records against all your past opponents
- Hall of Fame: aggregate stats on the best players you've drafted
